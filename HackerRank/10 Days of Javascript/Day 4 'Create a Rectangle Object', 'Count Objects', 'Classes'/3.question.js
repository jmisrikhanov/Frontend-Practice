// Task
// Create a Polygon class that has the following properties:
// . A constructor that takes an array of integer values describing the lengths of the
// polygon's sides.
// . A perimeter() method that returns the polygon's perimeter.
// Locked code in the editor tests the Polygon constructor and the perimeter method.
// Note: The perimeter method must be lowercase and spelled correctly.

/*
 * Implement a Polygon class with the following properties:
 * 1. A constructor that takes an array of integer side lengths.
 * 2. A 'perimeter' method that returns the sum of the Polygon's side lengths.
