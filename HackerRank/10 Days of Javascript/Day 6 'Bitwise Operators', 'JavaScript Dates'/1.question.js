// Task

// We define S to be a sequence of distinct sequential integers from 1 to n; in other
// words, S = {1, 2, 3, . . . ,n}. We want to know the maximum bitvvise AND value of
// any two integers, a and b (where a < b), in sequence S that is also less than a given
// integer, k.

// Complete the function in the editor so that given n and 13, it returns the maximum
// a&b<k

// Note: The 85 symbol represents the l3lE‘."‘-J'lSE AXJD operator.
